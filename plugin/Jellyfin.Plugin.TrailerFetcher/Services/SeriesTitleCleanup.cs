/// applied only in the series path, rather than folded into the shared
/// <see cref="ItemMetadata"/>/<see cref="TitleMatching"/> logic - a movie title never
/// has this kind of noise, so it has no business being in code the movie path also
/// runs. A multi-season "complete series" bundle folder (e.g. "... S1 - S5 [Full
/// Series] ...") can leave a season-range fragment in both Jellyfin's own matched Name
/// and the folder name itself - confirmed live: Jellyfin's Name for one such folder
/// came back as "Food Wars! (Shokugeki no Soma) S1" (only Jellyfin's own matching
/// already dropped the "- S5" part), which made every search query wrong since the
/// real trailers are titled just "Food Wars!"/"Shokugeki no Soma", no season suffix.
/// The two candidates are similar enough to each other that
/// TitleMatching.PreferFilenameOverMetadata's mismatch heuristic (built for a wrong
/// provider match, not consistently-polluted-but-agreeing metadata) doesn't catch it.
